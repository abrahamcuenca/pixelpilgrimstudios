This is the first official post for Pixel Pilgrim Studios!

My name is Abe, and this is my Game Dev log.
I want to build my first official game, which I can self-publish to game stores.

## The Game Idea
Most game dev tutorials on the web start with some platformer (think Super Mario Bros), but I wanted to do something different.

My inspiration was the original Tamagotchi Virtual Pet

Initially, this would be a mobile game since the target audience would be casual gamers with point-and-click/touch-based interactions.

The game mechanics would be attending to the pet's needs, interacting with the pet using various activities, and unlocking new interactions and items as the pet grows. In keeping with the spirit of mobile games, there would be daily log-in rewards and random events.

## The Tools
I tried out 9 different frameworks and game engines but ultimately decided on the Defold game engine.

I'll eventually have to find an artist for the artwork, but for now, I will be purchasing assets or creating my own with Aseprite, Procreate, or Photoshop/Illustrator.

I have Reason and Studio One and my Midi-keyboard for the music and sound effects.

## devlog
I'm going to share all my updates here. Sometimes it may be just a few notes to myself, and sometimes, I'll have screenshots or code snippets, but the best way for me to share the journey is to share all of it as it comes.

The next post will be a game design document and some screenshots of the initial prototype I've started building with Defold.

Until next time...
