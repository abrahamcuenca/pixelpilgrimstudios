# Game Overview
## Concept
EmojiPet is a casual Tamagotchi-style game where players can take care of a virtual pet by feeding, grooming, and entertaining it. The game focuses on nurturing the pet to keep it happy and healthy while developing a bond with the player.

Players unlock new interactions, mini-games, and items to use as the pet grows.
The game continues indefinitely, intending to keep the pet happy and healthy.

## Look and Feel
The game features a 2D, cartoon-like art style with bright colors. The user interface is simple and intuitive.

I know this is a lot to take in at once and even then it is not comprehensive. It's more of a 30k foot view but should work as a guide to get started.

Unfortunately, since I have no budget I'm going to wear all the hats and do all the work meaning that this estimated timeline will probably be triple what I've outlined here but we have to start somewhere.

Until next time...
